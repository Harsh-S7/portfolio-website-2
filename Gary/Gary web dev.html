      Duke presented unprecedented scale and diversity of opportunity. My four years of phenomenal professors across the disciplines pushed me to expand, challenge, and adjust my worldview. My experience dancing with DefMo showed me the power of empathetic leadership and expanded my artistic comfort zone. My tenure throwing major, campus-wide events validated that quality stems from attention to detail. My junior fall semester abroad at London's UCL humbled me to explore my place in the world.
      My engagement in Duke's tech & innovation initiatives exercised my creative muscle, sparked my obsession with design, and strengthened my tolerance to adversity.

    <p class="jobtext">
      This summer was a rite of passage into software engineering professionalism. Google's crash-course seminars opened my eyes to exciting new fields, the customer-driven culture taught me that empathy matters so much, time well spent. Developers and designers blew me away with their willingness to share their time and wisdom.
      The trust my teammates placed in me did wonders for my confidence in writing quality software. I continue to be inspired by this company today.

      Flipboard taught me to surround myself with people who pushed me to my limits. The summer hacking alongside brilliant engineers, shadowing masterful designers, and helping direct projects laid the foundation for my software-engineering career.

      I was the first, lucky intern to work with Pocket's small, brilliant team. During these couple of months, I queried SQL data to create user analytics reports, implemented initiatives to guide product launches using A/B test results, designed Google Analytics dashboards, aided with community support, and participated in the product design process. 
      This startup crash-course of a summer flooded me with opportunities to osmose bits of wisdom from founders, engineers, investors, and other leaders of the Valley.
